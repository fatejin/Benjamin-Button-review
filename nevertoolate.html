    <strong>For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be.</strong> There's no time limit, start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of, and if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again. 
            plus, what you want to go for, what you love to do, just follow your passion. your life will be shining over again and time will be showing you as well.
